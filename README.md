# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java** repository! This repo is designed to help you not just learn how to code DSA problems but also to understand the concepts behind them. Iâ€™ve organized the repository to include a wide variety of topics, from fundamental data structures to advanced algorithms, lab tasks, and past papers for practice.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Arrays
- **Searching in Array:** Implementations of searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** A collection of common sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Sorting2DArray:** Techniques to sort two-dimensional arrays, which is often required in complex problems.

### 2. Linked Lists
- **Linked_List:** A basic implementation of singly linked lists with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Linked_List_With_Double_Data:** An extended linked list that handles nodes with two data fields, demonstrating more complex linked list structures.

### 3. Stack and Queue
- **Stack Implementation & Methods:** An introduction to stacks, showcasing basic operations like push, pop, and peek, along with usage scenarios.
- **Queue Implementation & Methods:** Queue implementation with methods such as enqueue, dequeue, and front. Learn the differences between stacks and queues and when to use each.

### 4. Trees and Graphs
- **Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST):** Concepts and implementation of binary trees and binary search trees. Understand tree traversal methods such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order.
- **AVL Trees:** Learn about self-balancing binary search trees and their importance in maintaining O(log n) search times.
- **Graphs, BFS, and DFS:** Implementation of graph data structures and traversal techniques like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

### 5. Hash Tables
- Implement hash tables and understand their usage in optimizing search operations.

### 6. Recursion
- Dive into recursive algorithms, understand their base and recursive cases, and see how recursion simplifies complex problems.

### 7. Lab Tasks
- **All Lab Tasks:** This section includes all the lab tasks covered throughout the course. Each task is designed to solidify your understanding of key concepts by applying them to practical problems. Topics include:
  - Array manipulations and advanced searching/sorting techniques.
  - Linked list operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
  - Implementations of stacks and queues with real-world problem-solving examples.
  - Recursive functions and their applications.
  - Tree and graph data structures, including binary trees, AVL trees, and graph traversals.
  - Hash tables and their implementation details.
  
  These lab tasks are crucial for gaining hands-on experience and are aligned with the course curriculum to ensure comprehensive learning.

### 8. Past Papers
- **Past-paper-2021 and Past-paper-2023:** Practice with past exam papers to test your understanding of the concepts and improve your problem-solving skills.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Learn the Concepts:** Donâ€™t just copy and paste codeâ€”try to understand why each algorithm or data structure works. Each implementation is meant to be a learning tool, not just a code snippet.
  
2. **Hands-On Practice:** Clone the repository and play around with the code. Modify it, break it, and fix itâ€”this is the best way to learn.

3. **Lab Task Practice:** Ensure you complete all the lab tasks as they are designed to reinforce the theoretical knowledge with practical application. 

4. **Ask Questions:** If you find something unclear or think thereâ€™s a mistake, please don't hesitate to open an issue or ask me directly. Learning is a collaborative effort, and I'm here to help.

5. **Fork and Share:** If you find this repository helpful, consider forking it, giving it a star, and sharing it with others who might benefit from it.
